# Vroom-it-Up
Hello there! Thank goodness you read this, some people just don't read these! Anyways let's continue...

# Types of files for download
There are 6 different types of uploads you can use, like:

Plain HTML: Small, easy, and you can send this to your friends!

Zip: Good for uploading to websites

Exe (Electron): Used for playing on a desktop without use of a browser

Exe (Installer): Installs the game onto your desktop

Exe (Linux): Used for Linux Desktops (64-bit x86 desktops only)

Sb3 (Scratch): Used to load the project on scratch

Note: To download the Electron, Installer and Linux versions go here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fe5JrNA40EcN87x8YxppjyuuAm0Aglwj?usp=sharing
This is due to me not knowing how to upload files bigger than 25mb yet
